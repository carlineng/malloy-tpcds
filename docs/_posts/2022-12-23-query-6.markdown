- [Pull Request](https://github.com/carlineng/malloy-tpcds/pull/9)
- Play with the query and results using the [Fiddle](https://carlineng.github.io/tpcds-fiddle/?q=6+-+Query+06&t=&m=TPC-DS).

Query 6 looks at how many store purchases occurred during the month of January 2001, where the item cost more than 20% of the average purchase price in that item's category. Those purchases are then grouped by the home state of the customer making the purchase, and any state where the count is less than 10 is filtered out.

Implementing the query did not require any changes to the Model. I wrote an ad-hoc source, which is used to calculate the average item price of each category, then an in-line join to the `all_sales` source in L13-15 below:

It's worth understanding what L13-15 are doing exactly. `all_sales_with_category_avg` is the name of a new ad-hoc source I'm defining in the query. The `is` keyword is equivalent to aliasing or assignment. `all_sales { ... }` means the new ad-hoc source is based on the `all_sales` source, and the curly braces contain whatever extensions I need to make. Finally the `-> { ... }` on L15 represents the start of a new query that uses `all_sales_with_category_avg` as the source. From there, it's a simple `GROUP BY` with some filters.

Thanks for tuning in! As always, any feedback, comments, or questions are welcome. Drop me a line on the [Malloy Slack](https://malloy-community.slack.com), username @carl.
